# Slither.io bot doing the Circle Method

This is a modified version of Slither.io bot by
Ermiya Eskandary, Th√©ophile Cailliau and others
(https://github.com/ErmiyaEskandary/slither.io-bot)

All intelligence, both genuine and artificial, has been eradicated. The bot is
therefore completely stupid. It can do one thing, and one thing only:
circle following its tail and hiding from other snakes.

To make the bot do its thing, play it manually until you get
to a size of 5 or 10 thousand, or more. Then leave the snake close to center of the map
and make a large **couter-clockwise** circle with head slightly overlapping with the tail.
Enable the bot. It will keep going along a circle, trying to expand when there are no
other snakes around.

One does not need intelligence to be successful. The bot's score easily exceeds 1 mln.
It just takes long time.

The bot will not work with clockwise circle, and if the snake is small. A good and
stable internet conenction is essential.

# Controls

To enable or disable the bot, use right mouse button. To zoom, use mouse wheel.

# Disclaimer

The code is raw, and I am unlikely to work on it in the future. Also, I don't know
any javascript, so the bot may be inefficient and slow. If you know how to make
it faster, open an issue on github, I would be interested.
